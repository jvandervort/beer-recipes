# German Altbier-1

Altbier is usually a dark, copper color. It is fermented at a moderate temperature using a top-fermenting yeast--which gives its flavour some fruitiness. Because Altbier is then matured at a cooler temperature, its flavour is more akin to lager beer styles than is the norm for top-fermented beers (such as British pale ale).

# Belgian Pale Ale

Belgian pale ales simultaneously express a firm, if understated, hop finish. Soft, creamy, not too sweet or too dry, easy to drink but also subtly complex, Belgian pale ale is a highly approachable style.

- 1 oz Saaz Hops (0 min) [hops]
- 1 pk LALBREW ABBAYE - Belgian Ale Yeast [yeast]
- 1 tsp Irish moss [clarifyer]

1. steep [specialty grains] during run up to boil
2. start boil, remove [specialty grains], add Cluster [hops] and Malt Extracts [malt]
3. at 45 minutes boil, Irish Moss [clarifyer]

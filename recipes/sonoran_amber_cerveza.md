# Sonoran Amber Cerveza

The Mexican Amber differs from the traditional Vienna Lager in its use of caramel malts and unmalted adjuncts such as flaked maize. Often lumped in with other International Amber Lagers, the Mexican variety is a beautiful copper-colored malt machine with easy-drinking notes of toast, occasional traces of adjuncts like corn, and occasionally slightly spicy hops. Malty sweetness often takes center stage over bitterness.
